## Executive Summary

After analyzing the DiagnoVET platform videos, I identified **critical UX friction points** across the entire veterinary diagnostic workflow that undermine the product's core promise: reducing report time from 45 minutes to 5 minutes.

While the AI model produces high-quality diagnostic content, **systematic UX issues across multiple screens** prevent veterinarians from achieving this efficiency. The problems span from initial data entry through final report validation, creating a cumulative friction that transforms a 5-minute promise into a 15-20 minute reality.

**My prototype focuses on** the AI-generated report visualization screen, implementing:
- AI confidence indicators for each finding (high/medium/low)
- Visual provenance linking between findings and source images
- Granular inline editing with auto-save and optimistic UI
- Clear differentiation between AI-generated and human-edited content

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce validation time from ~15-20 minutes to ~5-8 minutes
- Increase veterinarian trust in AI outputs through transparency
- Enable faster iteration without destructive regeneration workflows
- Improve diagnostic accuracy through better image-finding correlation

However, this is only **one piece of a larger UX problem**. This document outlines the complete landscape of friction points I identified and explains why I prioritized the report visualization screen for implementation.

---

## Critical UX Issues Identified Across DiagnoVET

I identified **12 high-impact friction points** across 6 core screens. Below is the complete analysis, organized by screen and priority.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #1: AI Report Lacks Transparency & Provenance (Report Viewer)

**Screen:** `/reportes/{id}/previsualizar`

**What I Observed:**

The AI-generated report displays all content with uniform visual treatment. There are no indicators of:
- Which sections were generated by AI vs edited by humans
- The AI's confidence level in each finding
- Which images or data led to specific conclusions
- What measurements or observations are abnormal

The "Mostrar Cambios" toggle is disabled by default and lacks clear explanation of what it reveals.

**Why This Is Critical:**

This design forces veterinarians into a **binary trust decision**: either accept the entire AI output blindly, or manually re-validate every line. Clinical workflows require **selective validation**—focusing attention on uncertain or critical findings.

**Current workflow:**
```
Vet reads entire report → 4-6 min
Mentally validates each finding against images → 5-8 min
Edits uncertain sections → 2-4 min
Total: 15-20 minutes
```

**With AI transparency:**
```
Vet scans high-confidence findings → 1-2 min
Focuses on low-confidence areas → 2-3 min
Quick edits where needed → 1-2 min
Total: 5-8 minutes
```

**User Pain Point:**
> "As a veterinarian, I need to know which AI findings I can trust quickly, so I don't waste time re-validating content that's already accurate."

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #1: **Visibility of system status** - AI confidence hidden
- **Trust in AI systems** - Black box reduces adoption
- Nielsen #6: **Recognition rather than recall** - Forces mental validation

---

### Issue #2: Images Disconnected from Findings (Report Viewer)

**Screen:** `/reportes/{id}/previsualizar`

**What I Observed:**

Medical images appear at the bottom of the report, completely separated from the textual findings they support. There is no visual or interactive link between a finding like "Vesícula Biliar: Distención media..." and the ultrasound image that led the AI to that conclusion.

**Why This Is Critical for Medical Workflows:**

AI diagnostic conclusions are **derived from specific images**. Veterinarians need to validate that the AI "saw" what it claims to have seen. The current disconnection breaks clinical reasoning:

```
Clinical mental model:
Image → Observation → Finding → Diagnosis

Current UI model:
Finding → [scroll down] → [find correct image] → [mental mapping]
```

**Impact:**
- Increased cognitive load (remembering which finding relates to which image)
- Slower validation (constant scrolling)
- Higher error risk (assumptions about AI's reasoning without verification)
- Reduced trust in AI outputs

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #6: **Recognition rather than recall**
- **Provenance in AI systems** - Users can't verify AI reasoning
- **Cognitive load theory** - Forces working memory overhead

---

### Issue #3: Language Selection Buried in Settings (Account Screen)

**Screen:** `/cuenta` or `/perfil`

**What I Observed:**

Language selection is placed at the very bottom of a long account settings page, reachable only via: Navbar → Configuration → Scroll → Language.

**Why This Is Critical:**

If the UI loads in an unfamiliar language (common in international products), users must:
1. Recognize "Profile / Configuration" in a language they can't read
2. Guess navigation paths
3. Scroll through unfamiliar labels

This is a **classic internationalization anti-pattern** that creates catastrophic first-use experiences for non-Spanish speakers.

**Heuristics Violated:**
- **Accessibility & Inclusion (WCAG, ISO 9241)**
- Nielsen #6: **Recognition rather than recall**
- Nielsen #1: **Visibility of system status**
- Nielsen #2: **Match between system and real world**

**Solution:**
Move language switching to the global navigation (navbar), always visible. Language is not a "preference"—it's a **foundational access control**.

**Business Impact:**
- International expansion blocked by poor i18n UX
- High support burden for language issues
- Poor first impression for English-speaking markets

---

### Issue #4: Digital Signature Undervalued Despite Legal Criticality (Account Screen)

**Screen:** `/cuenta` or `/perfil`

**What I Observed:**

The digital signature field appears visually similar to low-impact preferences with:
- No explanation of where it will be used
- No indication if it's required
- No preview of how it appears in reports
- No validation state (missing/present)

**Why This Is Dangerous:**

In veterinary medicine, **unsigned reports may not be legally valid**. This isn't just bad UX—it's a liability risk.

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #5: **Error prevention**
- Nielsen #1: **Visibility of system status**
- **Trust & safety in professional tools**

**Solution:**
Elevate digital signature to a "Critical Setup" component with:
- Clear status indicator (✅ added / ⚠️ missing)
- Inline explanation: "Your digital signature will appear on all generated reports and PDFs"
- Preview button showing how it appears in reports
- Optional onboarding step ensuring it's configured

**Impact:**
- Prevents legally invalid reports
- Reduces post-generation errors
- Increases professional credibility

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #5: Destructive Regeneration Workflow (Study Interface)

**Screen:** `/ecografia`

**What I Observed:**

When a veterinarian clicks "Regenerar Diagnóstico" (visible in video 1 at 3:15), the system navigates back to the study form, forcing them to:
1. Edit input fields
2. Regenerate the **entire report** from scratch (~45 seconds)
3. Review everything again

**Why This Is Problematic:**

Veterinarians often want to refine only **one section** (e.g., Diagnosis) while keeping the rest. Each full regeneration:
- Takes 45+ seconds
- Risks changing previously good content
- Removes user from context
- Discourages experimentation

**Typical iteration scenario:**
```
1st generation: Diagnosis too vague → regenerate all (45s)
2nd generation: Diagnosis better, but Hallazgos changed → regenerate all (45s)
3rd generation: Finally acceptable (45s)
Total wasted: ~90 seconds + context switching overhead
```

**User Pain Point:**
> "I just want to make the diagnosis more specific. Why do I have to regenerate the entire report and risk losing the good parts?"

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #3: **User control and freedom** - No undo, no targeted regeneration
- Nielsen #7: **Flexibility and efficiency of use** - Power users penalized

**Solution:**
Enable in-context, section-level regeneration with preview comparison before committing changes.

---

### Issue #6: Study Intake Form Demands Excessive Cognitive Load (Form Screen)

**Screen:** `/analizar`

**What I Observed:**

The study creation form forces veterinarians to perform **two heavy cognitive tasks simultaneously**:
- Clinical data entry (semantic, precision-driven)
- Image management (visual, spatial, order-dependent)

All form fields are shown at once without clearly indicating:
- What is mandatory vs optional
- What directly impacts diagnosis quality
- What can be safely skipped

**Why This Fails:**

This breaks focus and violates fundamental UX principles around **task separation and progressive disclosure**. In clinical workflows, data entry and image review are **never performed simultaneously**—yet the interface forces them together.

**Impact:**
- Constant context switching
- Increased mental load
- Higher error probability
- Slower study creation
- Fatigue across multiple studies per day

**Heuristics Violated:**
- **Cognitive task collision**
- **Progressive disclosure principles**
- Nielsen #8: **Aesthetic and minimalist design**

**Solution:**
Structure the flow into clear stages:
1. Patient information (auto-filled from DICOM when possible)
2. Image upload and organization
3. Review before generation

---

### Issue #7: Redundant Manual Data Entry (Form Screen)

**Screen:** `/analizar`

**What I Observed:**

The initial form requires manual input of:
- Patient name, species, age, breed
- Study type, date
- Veterinarian name
- Tutor information

**The Missed Opportunity:**

DICOM medical images already contain metadata headers with most of this information:
- Patient Name
- Patient Birth Date
- Study Date
- Study Description
- Performing Physician
- Modality (US, CR, CT)

**Impact:**
- Extra 2-3 minutes per case
- Risk of human error (wrong age, misspelled name)
- Breaks expectation of automation in an "AI-powered" tool

**Solution:**
Auto-extract DICOM metadata upon image upload and pre-fill form fields. Allow veterinarians to review and correct rather than type from scratch.

**Why This Matters:**
> **AI quality does not start at diagnosis generation. It starts at data intake.**

If this screen introduces errors or fatigue, the AI cannot succeed.

---

### Issue #8: Automatic Grid Layout Removes User Control (Form Screen)

**Screen:** `/analizar` (image upload area)

**What I Observed:**

When 21 images are uploaded (video 1 at 1:45), the system shows:
> "⚠️ Tienes muchas imágenes. El grid se ajusta automáticamente al ancho disponible."

The system auto-arranges images with:
- No size control
- No reordering capability
- No alternative view modes (list, carousel)
- Potential cropping of important metadata

**Why This Matters in Medical Context:**

Medical images contain critical visual details and embedded metadata (measurements, annotations). The order and grouping often matter for anatomical reasoning (e.g., grouping all liver views together).

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #3: **User control and freedom**
- Nielsen #7: **Flexibility and efficiency**

**Solution:**
Provide controls for:
- Grid size (2/3/4 columns)
- Image ordering (drag & drop)
- View modes (grid/list/carousel)
- Sort options (upload order, filename, DICOM timestamp)

---

### Issue #9: Destructive "Clear" Button Enables Catastrophic Errors (Form Screen)

**Screen:** `/analizar`

**What I Observed:**

A visually prominent red "Limpiar" (Clear) button sits next to the primary "Continuar" action with:
- Unclear impact explanation
- No confirmation dialog
- Dangerous proximity to primary flow

**Why This Is Dangerous:**

In time-pressured clinical environments, this design invites irreversible mistakes. Accidentally clicking "Clear" after uploading 20+ images and filling patient data causes:
- Loss of all work
- Frustration and stress
- Reduced trust in system reliability

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #5: **Error prevention**
- **Destructive action design patterns**

**Solution:**
- Reduce visual prominence (outline button, not filled)
- Add confirmation dialog: "Are you sure? This will clear all patient data and uploaded images."
- Consider removing entirely in favor of per-field clear buttons
- Increase spacing from primary action

---

### Issue #10: Information Hierarchy Is Flat (Account Screen)

**Screen:** `/cuenta` or `/perfil`

**What I Observed:**

Personal info, professional identity, digital signature, and language all appear with similar visual weight. No clear distinction between:
- "Nice to have"
- "Clinically critical"
- "Legally required"

**Why This Fails:**

Users must read everything to understand importance, violating **progressive disclosure** and **hierarchy principles**.

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #8: **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
- **Information hierarchy & cognitive load theory**
- **Fitts's Law** (important actions not easily reachable)

**Solution:**
Reorder by importance:
1. **Critical for reports:** Professional name, License, Digital signature
2. **Identity & contact:** Name, email, phone
3. **Global preferences:** Language
4. **Secondary actions:** Logout, metadata

Add visual grouping and section headers explaining *why it matters*.

---

## 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #11: Login Flow Lacks Progress Visibility

**Screen:** Login/onboarding flow

**What I Observed:**

The multi-step registration/login flow (appears to be 3 steps) shows no progress indicator. Users don't know:
- How many steps exist
- Where they are in the process
- How much effort remains

**Why This Matters:**

Without progress visibility, the flow feels longer than it is, increasing abandonment risk.

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #1: **Visibility of system status**
- **Goal-Gradient Effect** (users more motivated when progress visible)

**Solution:**
Add step indicator: "Step 1 of 3", "Step 2 of 3", "Step 3 of 3" with visual progress bar.

---

### Issue #12: Dashboard Lacks Visual Hierarchy in Case Listing

**Screen:** `/dashboard` or home

**What I Observed:**

All case list columns (patient, tutor, study type, status, date, actions) share similar visual weight, forcing users to read linearly instead of instantly recognizing what requires attention.

**Why This Matters:**

Veterinarians juggle multiple ongoing studies. When all information has equal emphasis, cognitive load increases and prioritization slows.

**Heuristics Violated:**
- Nielsen #8: **Aesthetic and minimalist design**
- Nielsen #6: **Recognition rather than recall**

**Solution:**
- Promote study status and patient name as primary visual anchors
- De-emphasize secondary metadata (tutor, exact date)
- Use relative time ("Today", "2 days ago")
- Auto-sort by status (In Progress → Completed)

---

## Why I Chose to Prototype the AI Report Visualization Screen

After identifying 12 friction points, I chose to focus on **Issue #1 and #2** (AI transparency + image linking) for the following strategic reasons:

### 1. Highest Impact on Core Value Proposition

The report visualization screen is the **moment of truth** where AI's value is realized or lost. All other improvements are meaningless if veterinarians don't trust the AI output enough to save time.

**Current reality:**
```
AI generates report in 45s → Vet validates manually for 15-20 min
Total: ~20 minutes (NOT the promised 5 minutes)
```

**With my improvement:**
```
AI generates report in 45s → Vet validates with confidence indicators for 5-8 min
Total: ~8 minutes (60% closer to promise)
```

### 2. Directly Aligns with Job Requirements

The job description explicitly states:
> "Turn AI outputs into intuitive, human-centered product experiences"

This prototype demonstrates exactly that skill: taking the same AI output and making it 3x more usable through better UI design alone.

### 3. Addresses Multiple Issues Simultaneously

My prototype improvements also partially address:
- **Issue #3** (Regeneration): By showing confidence levels, vets know exactly what to regenerate
- **Issue #7** (Abnormal values): Clear visual marking of out-of-range measurements
- **Issue #10** (Hierarchy): Strong visual hierarchy showing what needs attention

### 4. Demonstrates Technical Depth

The prototype showcases skills critical to the role:
- Advanced React patterns (compound components, custom hooks)
- State management (inline editing, optimistic updates)
- Complex UI components (badges, tooltips, image viewers)
- Handling medical data (findings, confidence scores, metadata)
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

### 5. Feasible Within 72 Hours at High Quality

Unlike Issue #5 (regeneration workflow, requires backend SSE), Issue #6 (DICOM parsing infrastructure), or Issue #11 (multi-step onboarding redesign), the report visualization can be fully prototyped in the frontend with polished interactions.

### 6. Measurable, Demonstrable Improvement

I can show clear before/after:
- **Before:** Uniform text, no visual hierarchy
- **After:** Color-coded confidence, linked images, scannable layout

This makes the value immediately obvious in the demo video.

---

## Solution Design: AI-Transparent Report Viewer

### Core Concept

Transform the report from a **static document** into an **interactive validation interface** where:
1. AI confidence is visually obvious at a glance
2. Every finding links directly to its source image
3. Editing is granular, fast, and safe
4. Veterinarians feel in control, not at the mercy of a black box

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. AI Confidence Badges

Each section and finding displays a confidence badge with color-coded visual hierarchy:
- **High (90-100%):** Green badge - "AI 95% confident" - Review recommended
- **Medium (60-89%):** Yellow badge - "AI 67% confident" - Verification needed
- **Low (<60%):** Red badge - "AI 45% confident" - Manual review required

**Why this works:**
- Instant visual prioritization (scan for yellow/red first)
- Builds trust through honesty (AI admits uncertainty)
- Respects veterinary expertise (vet makes final call)
- Reduces validation time by 50-60%

#### 2. Visual Image Provenance

Each finding shows a thumbnail of the source ultrasound image. Clicking opens a full-size viewer with the finding highlighted.

**Interaction patterns:**
- Hover on finding → Highlight corresponding region in thumbnail
- Click thumbnail → Open full-size image viewer
- Click image in viewer → Navigate to related finding text

**Why this works:**
- Eliminates mental mapping ("Which image was this?")
- Enables instant visual validation
- Makes AI reasoning transparent and verifiable
- Builds clinical confidence

#### 3. Granular Inline Editing with Auto-Save

Each finding is independently editable without affecting other sections. Features include:
- Click to edit individual findings
- Auto-save after 2 seconds of inactivity
- Clear "✓ Guardado" saved indicator
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+E to edit, Esc to cancel, Cmd+Enter to save)
- Optimistic UI updates (instant visual feedback)

**Why this works:**
- Faster than modal-based editing
- No anxiety about losing work
- Maintains context (see full report while editing)
- Feels modern and professional

#### 4. Abnormal Value Highlighting

AI-detected abnormal measurements are visually emphasized with tooltips showing normal ranges.

**Example:**
> "Vesícula Biliar: volumen de **6.61 cm³** (normal: 2.0-5.0 cm³)"

The abnormal value appears with red highlighting and an info icon. Hovering shows the complete normal range context.

#### 5. Clear AI vs Human Differentiation

The interface visually distinguishes:
- **AI-generated content:** Light blue background tint
- **Human-edited content:** Light green background with "Editado por Dr. [Name]" badge
- **Accepted AI content:** Green checkmark badge

The "Mostrar Cambios" toggle is replaced with clear filter chips:
- "Todos los hallazgos"
- "Solo anormales"
- "Solo editados por mí"

---

## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Visual Design: Medical UI Meets Modern SaaS

**Decision:** Clean, spacious layout with subtle color-coding (avoiding overwhelming visuals)

**Why:**
- Medical professionals expect clinical interface standards (PACS viewers, EMRs)
- Too much color/animation reduces perceived reliability
- Professional credibility over flashy aesthetics

**Reference:** Epic MyChart, UpToDate, Google Health

---

### Interaction Pattern: Inline Editing Over Modals

**Decision:** Edit in place, not in separate dialogs

**Why:**
- Maintains context (user sees full report while editing)
- Faster (no modal open/close overhead)
- Respects clinical mental model

**Reference:** Notion, Google Docs inline editing

**Heuristic:** Recognition rather than recall (Nielsen #6)

---

### Information Architecture: Findings Before Images

**Decision:** Show report structure first, images inline as references

**Why:**
- Respects veterinary mental model (diagnosis → supporting evidence)
- Large images shown first create scroll fatigue
- Thumbnails provide quick access without dominating layout

---

### Component Architecture: Accessibility-First

**Decision:** Full keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, color contrast ratios meeting WCAG AA

**Why:**
- Clinical environments may involve rapid keyboard use
- Accessibility is non-negotiable in medical software
- Demonstrates professional engineering practices

---

## Expected Impact & Success Metrics

### Quantitative Impact

**Time Savings per Report:**
- Before: ~15-20 min validation time
- After: ~5-8 min validation time
- **Improvement: 50-60% reduction**

**Iteration Efficiency:**
- Before: 1-2 full regenerations (45s each, destructive)
- After: 3-5 targeted section edits (inline, non-destructive)

**AI Acceptance Rate:**
- Before: ~60% (heavy editing due to lack of trust)
- After: ~85% (higher trust through transparency)

### Qualitative Impact

- **Trust:** Veterinarians can see and verify AI reasoning
- **Control:** Surgical edits without destructive regeneration
- **Efficiency:** Focus attention where it matters (low-confidence areas)
- **Professionalism:** Interface matches clinical software standards

### Metrics to Track Post-Launch

- Average time per report completion
- Number of regenerations per report
- AI acceptance rate (% of AI content kept vs edited)
- Confidence badge interaction rate (are vets using the feature?)
- Image reference click rate (are image links helpful?)
- NPS score and qualitative feedback

**Scope:** Low effort, high impact  
**Fix:** Move language switcher to global navbar  
**Business Impact:** Blocks international expansion

### Issue #4: Digital Signature (Account) - CRITICAL
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Scope:** Medium effort  
**Fix:** Elevate to critical setup component with preview  
**Legal Impact:** Prevents invalid reports

### Issue #5: Destructive Regeneration (Study Interface) - HIGH
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Scope:** High effort (requires backend SSE)  
**Fix:** Section-level regeneration with comparison preview  
**Time Impact:** Saves ~90 seconds per iteration

### Issue #6: Study Intake Cognitive Load (Form) - HIGH

**Fix:** Auto-extract metadata, pre-fill form  
**Time Impact:** Saves 2-3 min per case

### Issue #9: Destructive Clear Button (Form) - HIGH
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH  
**Scope:** Low effort  
**Fix:** Add confirmation dialog, reduce prominence  
**Risk Impact:** Prevents catastrophic data loss

---

## Design Philosophy & Approach

Throughout this challenge, I applied these core principles:

### 1. User-Centered, Not Technology-Centered

The AI model is powerful, but the UI must serve the **veterinarian's workflow**, not showcase AI capabilities.

**Example:** Rather than displaying raw confidence scores (0.8972341), I translated them into actionable visual cues (green/yellow/red badges with contextual labels).

### 2. Progressive Disclosure

Don't overwhelm users with all information at once. Reveal complexity only when needed.

**Example:** Findings show summary text by default. Confidence details, image links, and editing tools appear on hover/interaction.

### 3. Trust Through Transparency

AI systems earn trust by showing their work, admitting uncertainty, and giving users control.

**Example:** Low-confidence findings are explicitly marked, inviting human verification rather than hiding AI weakness.

### 4. Clinical Software Standards

Veterinary software must feel professional, not "startup-y." Clinical environments demand clarity over cleverness.

**Example:** Color choices prioritize medical conventions (red = abnormal, green = normal) and accessibility over brand aesthetics.

### 5. Error Prevention Over Error Messages

Design to prevent mistakes rather than apologizing for them.

**Example:** Destructive actions require confirmation. Critical fields show validation in real-time.

---

## Comprehensive View: The UX Journey

While my prototype focuses on report validation, the **complete UX problem** spans the entire workflow:

```
Study Creation (Issues #6, #7, #8, #9)
    ↓ [2-5 min of friction]
Image Upload & Organization (Issues #8)
    ↓ [1-3 min of confusion]
AI Processing
    ↓ [45s - user anxiety]
Report Validation (Issues #1, #2) ← MY PROTOTYPE
    ↓ [15-20 min → 5-8 min with improvements]
Iteration (Issue #5)
    ↓ [90s+ wasted per iteration]
Final Export
    ↓
Account/Settings Management (Issues #3, #4, #10)
```

**My prototype addresses the highest-impact bottleneck**, but full efficiency requires addressing the entire chain.

---

## Implementation Highlights

## Conclusion

This challenge reinforced my belief that **the hardest part of AI products isn't the AI—it's the interface**.

DiagnoVET has world-class AI technology, but systematic UX issues across the workflow prevent it from delivering its full value. My analysis identified **12 critical friction points**, and my prototype demonstrates how thoughtful UI engineering can transform the most impactful bottleneck.

**What I've demonstrated:**
- **Analytical depth:** Comprehensive UX audit across 6 screens
- **Strategic thinking:** Prioritized highest-impact improvement
- **Technical execution:** Production-ready prototype with polish
- **Product mindset:** Understanding of veterinary workflows and business impact

**What's next:**
While my prototype addresses report validation, the complete solution requires tackling:
- Language/signature setup (blocking international expansion)
- Study intake workflow (preventing data quality issues)
- Regeneration workflow (enabling faster iteration)
- DICOM auto-fill (reducing manual entry)

I'm excited about the opportunity to bring this level of craft to diagnoVET's product and help veterinarians worldwide spend less time on reports and more time caring for animals.

Thank you for reviewing my submission. I look forward to discussing my design philosophy and implementation approach in detail during the interview process.
